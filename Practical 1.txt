>>>> Write Programs to demonstrate knowledge of Python Basics.

1.1 Write a program to demonstrate variable creation in python

age = 45
salary = 14560
name = "up"
  
print(age)
print(salary)
print(name)

1.2 Write a program to demonstrate command input in python

uc = input("Enter Char: ")
uc = input("Enter age: ")
uc = input("Enter name: ")

1.3 Write a program to demonstrate numbers and stings in python

my_string = "Hello"
print(my_string)
 
name = "up"
print(name)
 
Age = "18"
print(Age)
 
my_string = "Hello hi"
print(my_string)


1.4 Write a program to demonstrate operators in python

up=input("x=")
up=input("y=")
 
Age=x+y
print(Age)

1.5 Write a program to demonstrate decision making in python

a=int(input("Enter 1 number : "))  
b=int(input("Enter 2 number : "))  
  
if(b!=0):  
    c=a/b  
    print("%d / %d = %d"%(a,b,c))

1.6 Write a program to demonstrate control structures in python

x = input("numeber :")
y = input("numeber :")
if (x == y):
   print("Both are Equal")
elif (x > y):
    print("x is larger than y")
else:
    print("x is smaller than y")

1.7 Write a program to demonstrate lists and dictionary in python

List = ["volvo", "lamborghini", "cadillac","land rover"]
print("My list of car: ")
print(List[3]) 
print(List[2])
